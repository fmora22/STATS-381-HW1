# (a) Create a vector called pepper consisting of the words Bell, Tabasco, Ghost
pepper <- c("Bell", "Tabasco", "Ghost")

# (b) Create a vector called scoville consisting of the Scoville Units as numbers
scoville <- c(0, 50, 855)

# (c) Create a vector called days consisting of the Growing Times as numbers.
days <- c(75, 80, 120)

# (d) Combine these three vectors to create a data frame called HeatScale.
HeatScale <- data.frame(Pepper = pepper, 
                        Scoville_Units = scoville, 
                        Growing_Time_Days = days)

# (e) Create a vector called cr consisting of these values (pepper, scoville, days).
cr <- data.frame(Pepper = "Carolina Reaper", 
                 Scoville_Units = 2000, 
                 Growing_Time_Days = 95)

# (f) Add cr as a row to HeatScale. (Make sure you work with the data frame you
# previously created, and not the original vectors.)
HeatScale <- rbind(HeatScale, cr)

# (g)Determine the variable type of each variable in HeatScale and describe any issues,
# if any, you observe. Include any code used and include your values as a comment
str(HeatScale) 
#Pepper are a characters which is p

# (h) Convert variables 
HeatScale$Pepper <- as.factor(HeatScale$Pepper)
HeatScale$Scoville_Units <- as.numeric(HeatScale$Scoville_Units)
HeatScale$Growing_Time_Days <- as.numeric(HeatScale$Growing_Time_Days)

# check updated data frame for the correct conversion
str(HeatScale)
